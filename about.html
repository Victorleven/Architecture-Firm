        <h1>About us</h1>
        <h2>
          Founded in 1997, Nordic Architecture & Design is built on the belief
          that architecture should be timeless, human-centered, and deeply
          connected to its surroundings. From the beginning, our goal has been
          to create spaces that feel natural — enhancing daily life while
          respecting the environment.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Led by CEO and founding architect Lars Nyström, our studio draws
          inspiration from Nordic traditions of simplicity, craftsmanship, and
          sustainability. Lars’s early experiences growing up along Sweden’s
          coastline shaped a design approach that values clarity, material
          honesty, and a strong sense of place. Today, Nordic continues to
          design enduring architecture that balances innovation with tradition —
          thoughtful spaces that invite reflection, belonging, and quiet beauty.

        <h2>Chief executive officer, Lars Nyström</h2>
        <p>
          Educated at Chalmers, Lars honed a sensitivity to material, light, and
          form that defines the firm’s work. His approach is grounded in the
          belief that architecture should be quiet yet powerful, offering spaces
          that enrich everyday life without overwhelming it. Under his
          leadership, Nordic Architecture & Design has earned a reputation for
          thoughtful, enduring design — blending Nordic traditions with a
          contemporary sensibility.
